        <h2> Decisive Analytics Intership </h2>
        <p>
          During the summer of 2017, I worked as a UI/UX intern at <a href="http://www.dac.us/"> Decisive Analytics Corporation </a>          in Arlington, Virginia. As an intern, I worked on a handul of frontend services used for data analytics and machine
          learning related applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are details and screenshots from two projects I worked on. I had the oppurtunity to build both of these UI's' from
          the ground up and both were passed on to full-time empoyess further development.

        <h3> SOL Version Control Frontend </h3>
        <p>
          This project served at a frontend UI for a version control system (akin to GIT) deisgned specifically for large numbers of
          structured data objects (think database enteries). The app functions much like a basic bitbucket or gitlab: users
          can view repositories and compare commits much like one would do with code. Built using Angular and Semantic UI
          and interfaced with an accociated REST API.

        <h3> ATLAS UI </h3>
        <p>
          Project ATLAS was a project for the U.S. army. The basic idea was that the army was building a video game to simulate and
          test new eqipment and techniques. Decisive Analytics was contracted to provide data analytics. This UI served as
          a propotype data visulazation platoform for the project. Since the game istelf was still under development, data
          for the game DOTA was used as for proof of concept.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major componet of the project was an alogrhtim that anaylzed player behavviors and dicrete actions. The video below demonstrates
          visulization of the output of algothrimm using player movement tracks from hundereds of games as input. The animation
          on the write is vizulaing player movements via HTML5 canvas.
